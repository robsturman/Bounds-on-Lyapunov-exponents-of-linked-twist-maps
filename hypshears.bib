We give an analytic expression for the largest Lyapunov exponent of products of random sparse matrices, with random elements located at random positions in the matrix. This expression is obtained through an analogy with the problem of random directed polymers on a Cayley tree (i.e., in the mean field limit), which itself can be solved using its relationship with random energy models (REM and GREM). For the random polymer problem with complex weights we find that, in addition to the high- and the low-temperature phases which were already known in the case of positive weights, the mean field theory predicts a new phase (phase III) which is dominated by interference effects.},

In this work, we give a rigorous explicit formula for the Lyapunov exponent for some binary infinite products of random 2*2 real matrices. All these products are constructed using only two types of matrices, A and B, which are chosen according to a stochastic process. The matrix A is singular, namely its determinant is zero. This formula is derived by using a particular decomposition for the matrix B, which allows us to write the Lyapunov exponent as a sum of convergent series. The key point is the computation of all the integer powers of B, which is achieved by a suitable change of frame. The computation then follows by looking at each of the special types of B (hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic). Finally, we show, with an example, that the Lyapunov exponent is a discontinuous function of the given parameter.},

The matrices in the product are such that one entry is gamma-distributed along a ray in the complex plane. When the ray is the positive real axis, the products are those associated with a continued fraction studied by Letac \& Seshadri [Z. Wahr. Verw. Geb. 62 (1983) 485-489], who showed that the distribution of the continued fraction is a generalised inverse Gaussian. We extend this result by finding the distribution for an arbitrary ray in the complex right-half plane, and thus compute the corresponding Lyapunov exponent explicitly. When the ray lies on the imaginary axis, the matrices in the infinite product coincide with the transfer matrices associated with a one-dimensional discrete Schrödinger operator with a random, gamma-distributed potential. Hence, the explicit knowledge of the Lyapunov exponent may be used to estimate the (exponential) rate of localisation of the eigenstates.},
